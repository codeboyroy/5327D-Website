# 5327D | Gael Force Robotics

## Team Overview

Our team, 5327D, is one of five sister teams within the Gael Force. As a team, we value the competitive spirit and always strive to give our best at any competition. However, our team values the knowledge and active involvement of our members over our competitive superiority. As a team, we ensure that each of our members know every aspect of VEX robotics, from the different motor gearings to the fine workings of a reverse-double four bar. Each of our members are equally qualified to manage either the build, programming, or notebook. Our team desires to make it as far as the world-level competition this year, setting our team's legacy in the Gael Force history.
